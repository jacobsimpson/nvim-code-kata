INTRODUCTION                                *nvim-code-kata-intro*

Keeps a list of code kata type problems and randomly selects one, taking into
account the weight assigned to the problem.

The problem list is kept in ~/.code-kata-problems.json

A directory will be created, a basic template file will be populated and vim
will be moved to that directory.
